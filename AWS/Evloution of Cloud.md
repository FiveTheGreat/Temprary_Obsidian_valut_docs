#### Distributed Computing
In 1950's Only Distributed Computing method was invented

It is run the method of one computer - one server. the cost efficiency of distributed computing is so high

A Storage Area of Storage devices connect by multiple Computer. It had many lag 
for an example if the one computer is make the bugs or anything it affected the main storage so. that bug reflacted all the connecting computers.

#### Mainframe Computing
![[Pasted image 20240805122745.png]] Mainframe Computing overcomes the cost efficiency of Distributed Computing.
In runs the method one server- connected by multiple computers.

#### Cluster Computing

In Cluster Computing it Connected by the internet and run the services it accessible for anywhere in the organization 

Cons : 
Over the organization it not accessible 

#### Grid Computing:

It Overcomes the Cluster Computing method it access by any geocraphical place but at the time most of the internet access LAN or ethernet only.

So It faces the many issue when hit or access the server
#### Virtualization:

Virtualization is the key concept of Cloud Computing

It is the method of run the multiple machines in one computer. one single machine runs the multiple os 

#### Utility Computing

In Virtualization machine only runs in virtual memory otherwise hardware are all run physical system. In Utility model all are run by virtual environment.

* Father of Cloud Computing is `Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider`
* Cloud Computing is a `Service`
* First time Sales force company provide the cloud platform after that google,microsoft are all given that services later
